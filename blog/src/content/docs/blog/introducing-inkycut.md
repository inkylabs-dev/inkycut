# Introducing InkyCut

I'm sure you've been there: import footage, drag to timeline, adjust cuts, add transitions, sync audio, add fancy stickers, render preview, realize it's not perfect, start over. 

Sound familiar? If you've ever tried to edit a video, you know the pain. The learning curve is steep, the interfaces are cluttered, and what should be creative ends up feeling like fighting with software.

That's exactly why we built **InkyCut**.

## The Problem We're Solving

Here's what typically happens when you want to create a video:

1. Learn a complex video editor (Premiere, Final Cut, whatever)
2. Import your media files and organize them
3. Drag clips to timeline tracks (hope you got the timing right)
4. Manually add transitions, effects, and text
5. Preview and realize something's off
6. Scrub through timeline, make adjustments
7. Repeat until it maybe works

This workflow assumes you want to become a video editor. But what if you just want to make a video?

## What We Built

InkyCut flips video editing on its head. Instead of timelines and tracks, you just **talk to it**.

### Vibe Editing, Not Timeline Wrestling

Describe what you want: "Make a 30-second intro with my logo, fade in some background music, and add the text 'Welcome to my channel' with a cool animation." 

That's it. Our AI figures out the rest.

### No Skills Required, Just Ideas

You don't need to learn keyframes, understand codecs, or memorize keyboard shortcuts. If you can describe what you want, InkyCut can build it. Think of it like "vibe coding" for video—pure creative intent, zero technical friction.

### Open Source, Open Spec

The entire editor is open source. The JSON schema we use to define compositions? Open. The video renderer? Open. You can contribute, extend it, or build your own tools on top of our specification.

## How It Actually Works

Let me show you a typical InkyCut session:

1. **Upload your media** - Drop in images, videos, audio files
2. **Chat with the AI** - "Create a product demo video with smooth transitions"
3. **Watch it build** - See your video come together in real-time
4. **Refine with conversation** - "Make the text bigger" or "Add a fade-out"

No timeline scrubbing. No track management. Just conversation.

## Built AI-First from Day Zero

Most video editors bolt AI onto existing workflows. We started with AI as the foundation. Every component—from the interface to the renderer—was designed around conversational editing.

The result? Video creation that feels natural, not technical.

## Free Forever, Open Always

InkyCut's core functionality will always be free. We believe creative tools shouldn't have paywalls. Premium features are coming, but the heart of the editor—AI-powered vibe editing—stays free.

Why? Because we think everyone should be able to create, regardless of budget or technical skill.

## What's Next

This is our MVP, but we're just getting started:

- **Advanced AI models** - More sophisticated understanding of creative intent
- **Collaboration features** - Share projects and edit together in real-time
- **Template marketplace** - Community-created starting points for common video types
- **Multi-format export** - Optimize for different platforms automatically

## Why We're Building This

As creators ourselves, we got tired of spending more time learning software than actually creating. Video editing shouldn't require a degree in software engineering.

InkyCut exists because we believe creative tools should amplify ideas, not complicate them.

Your vision matters more than your technical skills. InkyCut makes that possible.
