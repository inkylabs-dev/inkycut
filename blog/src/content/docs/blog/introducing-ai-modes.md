You know that moment when you open a video editor and suddenly feel overwhelmed by all the buttons, panels, and options? 

Well, InkyCut's AI chat doesn't have that problem. But here's something cool we discovered while building it: **different creative moments need different types of AI help**.

Sometimes you want the AI to take charge and handle everything. Other times you want precise control over each change. And occasionally, you just need to understand what's going on before making any moves.

That's why we built **three distinct AI modes**—each designed for a specific creative mindset.

## The Three Modes of Creative AI

### 🤖 Agent Mode: "Handle This For Me"

This is where the magic happens. You describe your end goal, and the AI agent breaks it down into steps and executes them automatically.

**Example conversation:**
> **You:** "Create a professional title sequence with our logo and company name"
> 
> **Agent:** Working on your title sequence...
> 
> **Step 1/8** - Reading current project structure  
> **Step 2/8** - Adding company logo element  
> **Step 3/8** - Positioning logo in center frame  
> **Step 4/8** - Creating title text with company name  
> **Step 5/8** - Adding fade-in animation to logo  
> **Step 6/8** - Adding slide-in animation to text  
> **Step 7/8** - Adjusting timing and spacing  
> **Step 8/8** - Adding background color  
> 
> **Goal Achieved!** Your professional title sequence is complete.

The agent **thinks in workflows**, not individual actions. It understands that "professional title sequence" means multiple coordinated steps: positioning, animations, timing, and visual hierarchy.

**Perfect for:**
- Complex, multi-step requests
- When you want to focus on creative vision, not implementation
- Learning new techniques (watch how the agent approaches problems)
- Rapid prototyping of ideas

### ✏️ Edit Mode: "Make This Specific Change"

Sometimes you know exactly what you want changed. Edit mode gives you precise, surgical control over your project.

**Example conversation:**
> **You:** "Make the title text bigger and move it to the top-left corner"
> 
> **AI:** I'll increase the font size to 48px and reposition the title to coordinates (50, 30) in the top-left area.
> 
> **Changes made:**
> - Modified title element font size: 32px → 48px
> - Updated position: center (960, 540) → top-left (50, 30)

Edit mode is **direct and predictable**. One request, one focused change. No surprises, no creative interpretation—just execution.

**Perfect for:**
- Fine-tuning specific elements
- Making quick adjustments
- When you know exactly what needs changing
- Maintaining full creative control

### 🔍 Ask Mode: "Help Me Understand This"

Before making changes, sometimes you need information. Ask mode analyzes your project and provides insights without modifying anything.

**Example conversation:**
> **You:** "What's the current structure of my video project?"
> 
> **AI:** Your project contains:
> 
> **Project Overview:**
> - 3 pages with total duration of 25 seconds
> - Resolution: 1920x1080 at 30fps
> - 12 total elements across all pages
> 
> **Page Breakdown:**
> - Page 1 "Intro" (8 sec): Logo, title text, background
> - Page 2 "Content" (12 sec): 6 text elements, 2 images
> - Page 3 "Outro" (5 sec): Call-to-action text, fade effect
> 
> **Recommendations:**
> - Consider adding transitions between pages
> - Page 2 has many elements—grouping might improve organization
> - Audio track could enhance the intro sequence

Ask mode is your **creative consultant**. It never changes anything, but helps you understand what you have and suggests what might work better.

**Perfect for:**
- Understanding complex projects
- Getting suggestions before making changes
- Learning video editing concepts
- Project audits and reviews

## Why Three Modes Matter

Different creative moments require different types of AI interaction:

**Starting a project?** → Agent mode handles the heavy lifting  
**Polishing details?** → Edit mode gives precise control  
**Feeling stuck?** → Ask mode provides insights and suggestions

**The best part?** Your AI remembers context across modes. Start with Agent to build the foundation, switch to Ask to understand the structure, then use Edit to perfect the details.

## Real Creative Workflows

Here's how the modes work together in practice:

### Workflow 1: The Rapid Prototype
1. **Agent:** "Create a product demo video"
2. **Ask:** "How does the pacing feel?"  
3. **Edit:** "Speed up the middle section by 20%"

### Workflow 2: The Collaborative Review
1. **Ask:** "Analyze the visual hierarchy"
2. **Edit:** "Make the headline more prominent"
3. **Agent:** "Add subtle animations to guide viewer attention"

### Workflow 3: The Learning Journey
1. **Ask:** "What makes a good title sequence?"
2. **Agent:** "Create an example title sequence"
3. **Edit:** "Change the colors to match our brand"

## Under the Hood: How It Actually Works

**Agent Mode** uses multi-step planning with tool execution. It breaks complex requests into logical steps and executes them systematically.

**Edit Mode** uses single-step execution with precise targeting. It maps your request to specific project modifications.

**Ask Mode** uses analysis-only processing. It reads your project structure and provides insights without making changes.

All three modes share the same understanding of your project, but approach interaction completely differently.

## Configurable Intelligence

Want more control? The Settings panel lets you customize your AI experience:

- **Maximum Steps** (1-20): How complex can Agent mode get?
- **Creativity Level** (0-1): More focused vs. more experimental?
- **AI Model**: Balance speed vs. capability for your workflow

Your preferences persist across sessions, so your AI learns how you like to work.

## The Future of Creative AI

These three modes represent something bigger: **AI that adapts to human creative processes**, not the other way around.

Traditional software forces you to learn its workflow. InkyCut's AI modes meet you where you are creatively:

- **Exploring?** Agent mode handles execution while you focus on vision
- **Refining?** Edit mode gives surgical precision
- **Learning?** Ask mode provides insights without pressure

## What's Next

We're constantly improving how these modes understand creative intent:

- **More Tools** for diverse video editing tasks
- **Better context understanding** across mode switches
- **Advanced workflow patterns** for common creative scenarios  
- **Custom mode configurations** for specific use cases

## Why This Matters

Video editing isn't just about software—it's about translating creative vision into reality. Different moments in that translation need different types of help.

Sometimes you need a creative partner who takes initiative. Sometimes you need a precise tool that does exactly what you say. Sometimes you need a consultant who helps you understand what you have.

InkyCut's three AI modes give you all three, in one conversation.
